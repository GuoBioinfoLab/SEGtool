Description: This package detect specifically expressed gene in 
	expression profile. Such genes are significantly
        up- or down-expressed in a small number of samples. This work 
	performed by modified FCM Algorithm, modified jaccard coeffience,
	and some criterias. expresson data can from different tissues, organs 
	or any other sources that you wish to compare in expression profile.
